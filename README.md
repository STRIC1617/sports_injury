## Project Overview

The main goals of this project are to:
- Analyze the relationships between player characteristics and injury recovery times.
- Visualize injury trends.
- Build and evaluate regression models to predict recovery times based on player attributes and injury types.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python 3.x installed. You can set up a virtual environment and install the required packages as follows:

```bash```
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install required packages
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib Flask


Make sure to also download the dataset player_injury_data.csv and place it in the dataset folder.

## Usage
# Data Processing and Model Training:

Run the model_training.py script to preprocess the data, train regression models, and save the trained models and metrics visualizations.

python model_training.py


# Web Application:

The Flask web app allows users to input player data and predict injury recovery times.
Run the app with:

python app.py


## Data Sources
The dataset used for this analysis includes player injury data, player characteristics, and club statistics. It can be found in the dataset directory.
# Models
This project employs several regression models for predicting recovery times:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor (KNN)
# Ensemble methods used:

- Voting Regressor
- Stacking Regressor
# The models are evaluated using metrics such as:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (RÂ²)
## Visualizations
# The project generates visualizations to analyze:

- Distribution of injuries
- Age distribution of injured players
- Recovery times based on age and club budget
- Performance metrics for regression models

#
All figures are saved in the figures directory.
